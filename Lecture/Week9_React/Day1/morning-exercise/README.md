1. Recreate a simple version of the Employee List application in React using vite
2. This time, use this free API to get the data you need about employees: https://reqres.in/
3. Use the useEffect Hook to fetch data when your application loads for the first time
4. Create everything in the App component first, then break it up into multiple components (Header, SearchBar, etc.)
5. (STRETCH) Notice the data mentions multiple pages. Use a URL Query to make multiple requests to different pages.
	Try using Promise.all (research this on MDN) to handle multiple requests.
